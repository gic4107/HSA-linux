/* Each device exposes a doorbell aperture, a PCI MMIO aperture that receives 32-bit writes that are passed to queues
** as wptr values.
** The doorbells are intended to be written by applications as part of queueing work on user-mode queues.
** We assign doorbells to applications in PAGE_SIZE-sized and aligned chunks. We map the doorbell address space into
** user-mode when a process creates its first queue on each device.
** Although the mapping is done by KFD, it is equivalent to an mmap of the /dev/kfd with the particular device encoded
** in the mmap offset.
** There will be other uses for mmap of /dev/kfd, so only a range of offsets (KFD_MMAP_DOORBELL_START-END) is used for
